## How to Run The Codes

### Part 1: Pre-trained model
- Run all code blocks. 
  - It will load the Distilbert model and run a small example demonstrating how the model works.

### Part 2: Data Pre-processing
- Download the files(SenateVotes120k.csv, SenateVotes2022.csv) in the similar github.
  - SenateVote120k.csv contains data within year of 2021 and SenateVotes2022.csv contains data within year of 2022.
- Run all code blocks.
  -  It load data in 2021 and 2022 seperately and combines them together.

### Part 3: Training
- Change parameters in the third code block if needed.
- Run all code blocks.
  -  Train the model. A few example bills with predicted votes are shown at the last few code blocks.
